# Telecom-Churn
In the telecom industry, customers can choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

To do so, we are:
1. Analyzing the customer-level data of a leading telecom firm,
2. Building the predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn,
3. Identifying the main indicators of churn.

### The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months.
